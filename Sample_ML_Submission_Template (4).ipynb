        "The rapid growth of online food delivery platforms has generated large volumes of data related to restaurants, customer preferences, and reviews. Zomato, being one of the leading food discovery and delivery platforms, provides rich datasets that can be leveraged to gain meaningful business insights. This project focuses on analyzing Zomato restaurant data using data analysis and unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify patterns and group similar restaurants based on their characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project uses two primary datasets: one containing restaurant names and metadata such as location, cuisine type, cost for two, and ratings, and another containing customer reviews and feedback. The initial phase of the project involved loading the datasets into Python using the Pandas library and performing data understanding to examine the structure, data types, and overall quality of the data. Data preprocessing steps were then applied to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize relevant columns to ensure accuracy and consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to uncover hidden patterns and trends within the data. Various visualizations were created to analyze the distribution of restaurant ratings, cost ranges, popular cuisines, and location-based restaurant density. The analysis revealed important relationships, such as how pricing impacts customer ratings and which cuisines are most preferred in different areas. These insights helped in understanding customer behavior and market segmentation in the food service industry.\n",
        "\n",
        "To further enhance the analysis, unsupervised machine learning was applied using the KMeans clustering algorithm. Key numerical features such as ratings and cost were selected and scaled to improve model performance. The Elbow Method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters, ensuring effective grouping of restaurants. Based on the clustering results, restaurants were categorized into distinct groups, including budget-friendly restaurants with moderate ratings, premium restaurants with higher costs and ratings, and mid-range restaurants offering balanced value.\n",
        "\n",
        "The clustering results provide practical business value for multiple stakeholders. Customers can benefit from personalized restaurant recommendations, while restaurant owners and food delivery platforms can use these insights for targeted marketing strategies, pricing optimization, and location-based expansion planning. The project demonstrates how unsupervised learning can be used to segment businesses without predefined labels, making it highly relevant for real-world applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this project showcases a complete data analytics workflow, including data collection, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature selection, and machine learning implementation. It highlights the effective use of Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn to solve a real-world problem. The project serves as a strong portfolio example for aspiring data analysts and machine learning practitioners, demonstrating both technical skills and business-oriented analytical thinking."

        "Online food platforms such as Zomato rely primarily on user ratings and reviews to influence customer decisions and restaurant visibility. However, numerical ratings are often subjective and may not accurately reflect true customer satisfaction. Written reviews contain valuable qualitative insights, but they are unstructured and difficult to analyze at scale. This creates a gap between customer sentiment and the ratings presented on the platform. As a result, customers may make unreliable choices, and restaurants may receive unclear feedback on performance. There is a need for a data-driven approach that combines restaurant metadata with review analysis to uncover meaningful patterns. This project addresses the challenge by applying exploratory data analysis and sentiment-based insights to better understand customer behavior and restaurant performance."

This helps reduce the influence of common, less informative words while emphasizing terms that better represent customer opinions.

First, I applied variance thresholding to remove low-variance features that contribute little to prediction. Then, I performed correlation-based feature elimination to drop highly correlated features and reduce multicollinearity. After that, I used statistical feature selection (SelectKBest with ANOVA F-test) to retain features that have a strong relationship with the target variable. Finally, I applied L1 regularization (Lasso), which automatically shrinks less important feature coefficients to zero, effectively selecting only the most impactful features. This layered approach helped reduce noise, remove redundancy, and keep only meaningful features, improving model stability and preventing overfitting."

These features were important because they carried unique, non-redundant information and had a direct predictive relationship with the target variable. Highly correlated or low-variance features were discarded as they duplicated information or added noise, increasing the risk of overfitting. The final selected features consistently improved model performance during validation, indicating that they contributed meaningful signal rather than memorizing patterns in the training data."

Recall was prioritized to minimize missed opportunities by correctly identifying as many true positive cases as possible. The F1-score was considered the most critical metric as it provides a balanced measure of precision and recall, especially in situations where class imbalance exists, which is common in real-world business data. Accuracy was used as a supporting metric to understand overall correctness, but it was not relied upon alone since high accuracy can be misleading when one class dominates the dataset."

        "In this project, we analyzed Zomato restaurant data to understand key patterns related to restaurant ratings, pricing, cuisines, and customer preferences. The dataset was cleaned and explored using exploratory data analysis (EDA), which helped uncover meaningful insights such as the relationship between cost and ratings, popular cuisines, and location-based trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically KMeans clustering, restaurants were grouped into distinct clusters based on their features. Each cluster represents a unique category of restaurants, such as budget-friendly restaurants with average ratings, premium restaurants with higher costs and ratings, and mid-range restaurants with balanced characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "The clustering results provide valuable insights for both customers and business stakeholders. Customers can use these insights to choose restaurants that match their preferences, while restaurant owners and food delivery platforms like Zomato can use them for targeted marketing, pricing strategies, and business expansion decisions.\n",

        "Overall, this project demonstrates the effective use of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and unsupervised learning to solve a real-world business problem, making it a strong foundation for a data analyst or machine learning portfolio."
